<h3> Source: United States Department of Labor, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm" target="_blank">American Time Use Survey Summary</a></h3>

<p>According to the United States Department of Labor, in 2017 an American Time Use Survey (ATUS) was conducted and in 2018 the results were released. The data includes the average amount of time per day in 2017 that individuals worked, did household activities, and engaged in leisure and sports activities. Additionally, measures of the average time per day spent providing childcare--both as a primary (or main) activity and while doing other things--for the combined years 2013-17 are provided.</p>
